[B]v0.1.5[/B] - [2015-10-15]
- adjustments to default.py.  mode: 'Download' fixed up a bit. This is for when downloading what's currently playing, a direct url to the video.
- adjustments to default.py.  mode: 'ResolveAndDownload' added.  This is for when you need to resolve the url of the video, for say if your passing a hosted file link from another addon.
### Usage Example for 1Channel: contextMenuItems.append(('Download Movie','XBMC.RunPlugin(%s)'%_1CH.build_plugin_url({'destpath':destPath,'destfile':title+' ('+year+')'+eXt,'img':img,'mode':'ResolveAndDownload','section':'movies','url':item['url']}).replace('plugin://plugin.video.1channel/','plugin://plugin.program.dreamcatcher/') ))
### Usage Example for what to pass: {'destpath':'C:\\Movies\\','destfile':'test.mp4','mode':'ResolveAndDownload','section':'movies','url':'http://.../amber_seas.flv'}

- adjustments to c_HiddenDownloader.py. destPath variable name on one line adjusted to destpath.

[B]About[/B]
- This addon can be used to download what your currently watching.
- It grabs information from XBMC on what what's currently running in the player.
- Currently it can download either Music as .mp3 or Video as .flv.  You can always rename things later.
- At the moment, this will not work for live streaming content that doesn't handle being saved as-is.
- This method actually downloads a 2nd copy of what your watching.
- Currently, I do not have information on how to catch the buffering cache of what is being watched.
- For my own use, I've edited VideoOSD.xml to put a record button that I can siply click on to start the download.
- There are some naming-options in Addon Settings.
- For those wanting a copy of my VideoOSD.xml, which should work for most Confluence skins, I've included it.  I do not have a method setup currently to copy it over since there is so many possible skin.
